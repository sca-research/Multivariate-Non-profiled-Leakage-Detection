# Multivariate-Non-profiled-Leakage-Detection
This repository contains the practical implementation of several multivariate leakage detection tests considered in the IACR-Tches 2026, Volume 2 paper titled **Multivariate Leakage Detection**. The research was conducted by the Cybersecurity research group at the University of Klagenfurt, Austria. In this repository, we primarily focused on a comparative study of different non-profiled multivariate detection methods, along with multiplicity corrections for existing univariate detection methods.      

# General Introduction 
- The project contains the `Python` implementation of three multivariate leakage detection tests, namely, the distance covariance estimator (aka MV-dcov), the Diagonal $T$--test, and Hotelling's $T^2$. We have also considered Bonferroni's multiplicity correction techniques for four univariate leakage detection tests, namely Welch's $t$--test, $\chi^2$--test, mutual information based $G$--test, and distance correlation based test of independence (aka dcor).
