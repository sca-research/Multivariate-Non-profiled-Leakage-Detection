## Downloading Traces of PRESENT-RC dataset for leakage detection
- We have utilized the [DL-LA](https://github.com/Chair-for-Security-Engineering/DL-LA?tab=readme-ov-file) git repository to download the dataset: [FPGA_PRESENT_RANDOMIZED_CLOCK.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gYerTpnJF_u-BrP5ny0c6rcgbuKQlE4h/view) and unzip it.
- To store the data in a '.npy' file for our leakage detection, run:
                                                                      ```ruby
                                                                       python3 DUT.py
                                                                      ```
